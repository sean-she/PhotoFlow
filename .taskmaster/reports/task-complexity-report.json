			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Database Schema with Prisma",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema design into entity-specific modeling, relationship mapping, constraint definition, migration setup, and seed data generation. For each subtask, specify the models involved, required constraints, and test cases for validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing a foundational database schema with multiple entities, complex relationships, and constraints. It requires careful planning to ensure referential integrity, proper indexing, and migration safety.
